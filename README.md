Overview
The goal of this project is to predict if a job applicant will get a job based on multiple factors, such as their qualifications, experience, and skills. A machine learning model is trained on historical job data to make accurate predictions.

Data Collection
Input Data
Data includes:

Candidate Information: Skills, education, experience, location, etc.
Job Requirements: Skills required, job location, experience level.
Outcome: Whether the candidate was hired or not (1 = hired, 0 = not hired).
Data Format
The data is stored in a structured format like CSV or JSON:

candidate_skills, education_level, years_of_experience, job_location, hired (0/1), etc.
Model Training
The model is trained using a dataset with historical job application data. Common models used for this project include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The model predicts the likelihood of being hired based on the candidate's features.

Prediction Process
Once the model is trained, you can input a new candidateâ€™s details and receive a prediction on whether they are likely to be hired for a given job.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
